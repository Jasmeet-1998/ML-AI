#Object Detection via Open-CV , COCO Dataset and Mobile SSD(Single shot detection n/w better than YOLO).

SSD (that uses multi-scale convolutional feature maps at the top of the network instead of fully connected layers as YOLO does) is faster and more accurate than YOLO.

YOLO requires GPU otherwise it is slow while mobile-net SSD can operate faster evern with CPU.

mobile-net SSD can also be used with Raspberry-pi.
 
Dependancies->

1.)opencv-python

2.)COCO dataset

3.)mobilenet-SSD(Could be found in Open CV Documentation.)
